# This script invokes geth with the following options:
#  - The Ethereum data directory is set .ethereum within the current directory, which will be created if required.
#  - HTTP-RPC is enabled.
#  - Ethereum's experimental Whisper message facility is enabled.
#  - The Rinkeby test network is used; no actual money will be risked for this test.
#  - Inter-process communication will be via a virtual file located at .ethereum/geth.ipc.
#  - A log file for the `geth` output will be written, or overwritten, in logs/geth.log;
#    the log/ directory will be if it does not already exist.
#
# You will see the message "No etherbase set and no accounts found as default".
# Etherbase is the index into personal.listAccounts which determines the account to send Ether too.
# You can specify this value with the option --etherbase 0

# geth -h  # displays the geth help message, previously saved in geth.md
